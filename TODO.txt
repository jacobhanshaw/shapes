ConvexPolygon collision detection

Important:
-Rectangle
-rename booleans to is...()
-make direction, center, etc. consistently private or protected
-Count
-Triangle
-commenting, external documentation
-equals(), toString(), other basic methods
-ensure width consistently comes before height (and x before y)

Trivialities:
-make imports consistent (* or not)
-ensure partitioning of methods between Geometry and Shape subclasses is consistent

Bugs:
-Speech isn't visible when shape goes off the right or top of the screen
-All Direction.LEFT are the same object

Wishlist:
-more speech options: font
-Music
-border behavior (wrapping is difficult)
-expanded solidity options
-gravity, bounce
-render layers
